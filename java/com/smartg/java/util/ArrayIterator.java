/**
 * Simple array enumeration. Do we really need this? Hmm... Good question. We
 * can surely do it without this class, but using this class wir can make it
 * shorter:
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * <code>
 * public Enumeration<String> names() throws IOException {
 *	return new SafeEnumerationWrapper<String>(Arrays.asList(list()).iterator());
 * }
 * 
 *  public Enumeration<String> names() throws IOException {
 * 	return new ArrayEnumeration<String>(list());
 *  }
 *  
 *  </code>
